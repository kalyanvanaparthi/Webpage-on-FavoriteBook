	<p style="color:Cornsilk;">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is definitely the eighth book in the Harry Potter series, picking up from where we left – nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts. This book, written by John Tiffany and Jack Thorne is based on a story written by our queen, JK Rowlin</p>
</section>

<p style="color:Cornsilk;">Released as a special rehearsal edition script, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is divided into two parts and is spread across four acts and various scenes. As is common knowledge for the Potter fandom, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child traces the tumultuous relationship between Harry Potter, a thirty-seven-year-old ‘overworked Ministry of Magic employee’, and his son Albus Severus Potter, who has to carry the weight of unwanted popularity and history that comes attached to his last name.</p>

	<p style="color:Cornsilk;"> But, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has more than that to offer. It brings our favourites Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny and the much-hated Draco Malfoy together in situations where they can’t escape each other. It also has mentions of many dead characters – Dumbledore, Cedric Diggory, Lord Voldemort, James and Lily Potter – and all of them have something to contribute in their own unique ways. The book is compelling enough, like its predecessors, to force you to not put it down. At the same time, it is a light-reading book with less text, which adds to the ease of reading. </p>

<p style="color:Cornsilk;"> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child traverses through our pleasant and unpleasant memories of the wizarding world – students boarding the Hogwarts Express at platform nine and three-quarters, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, centaurs in the Forbidden Forest, Ministry of Magic, the treacherous floo powder mode of travel, the Godric’s Hollow, the Triwizard Tournament and what not! It juggles between the past and the present in ways that could change their future to extents that are unimaginable and unforeseen.<br>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child brings to the fore the troubles of dealing with both famous and infamous legacies, of fragile human relationships, of having a shot at altering your life and deciding who to put first – yourself or others.
